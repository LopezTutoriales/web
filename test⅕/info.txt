This is an automated injection service for all games which can be used for dsihax.
You will most working games in the following lists:
- Working games with QR-Code for eShop EUR, USA, JPN: https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(dsiware-game-injection-list)
- Compatible List of DSIgames for EUR: https://pastebin.com/11hAkpKM
- Compatible List of DSIgames for USA: https://pastebin.com/SvDswdgV
- Zelda: Four Swords EUR, USA and JPN
- Petit Computer, Legends of Exidia, Fieldrunners, Guitar Rock Tour EUR, US (removed from eshop)
- WarioWare Touched EUR, US (Club Nintendo prize no longer available)
- If your game is not on any of the above lists, there is still a good chance it will work (US and EU only)! Just give it a shot!

INFORMATION:
- Please don't upload movable_part1.sed or movable_part2.sed, these are completely different from movable.sed and will not work.
- The last failed builds I have seen haved failed because of a wrong movable.sed. Please make sure the movable.sed is the correct one. To check if this is the reason why your build has failed, please look at the console output and search if there is the following error: "ValueError: Error 65537 while instatiating the CBC mode" or "Error: decryption failed, this likely means an incorrect movable.sed".
This mostly happens because one of the following mistakes:
1. You took the dsiware.bin from the wrong id0 folder. Id0 example: sdmc:/Nintendo 3DS/(this->)abcdef0123456789abcdhf0123456789 
2. You used the wrong id0 while brute forcing if there was more than one id0 side-by-side in your Nintendo 3DS folder.
Solutions:
1. Upload the dsiware.bin from the correct id0 folder (the current one your 3ds is using) in "Nintendo DSiWare".
2. This should now be corrected automatically by the service in most cases.

- I've added a functionality to send a anonymous msed_data file to zoogie (creator of seedminer) for each injection done with this service. This file has no personal or console unique information and is only used to improve the seedminer even more by making better guesses where to start brute-forcing. This leads to much faster brute forcing for future users. It has already improved speed by over 5 times, which undoubtedly helped your brute force!
